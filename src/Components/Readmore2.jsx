            <img src="https://www.appliancerepair512.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iStock-1424529047-1200x800.jpg" alt="bg2"></img><br></br>
           <p>Garbage disposals can be very convenient. You rinse food scraps right off the plate or cutting board and run the disposal until they disappear down the drain. It keeps smelly food out of your trash and prevents your drain from clogging. However, this is only the case if your disposal is working properly. 

When your garbage disposal is not working properly, it can cause a variety of problems in your kitchen. Here are 5 reasons you need garbage disposal repair.

            <h1>1. Your Drain Will Clear Up.</h1><br></br>
            <p> A garbage disposal that is jammed or clogged will cause your drain to back up into your sink. This means all of the food scraps and debris from inside your disposal and drain pipes will come up into your sink, causing a disgusting, smelly mess. Repairing your garbage disposal will allow it to grind up the food scraps as it is supposed to so that the water will drain out and down the pipe. </p>
            <h1>2. Your Dishwasher Will Work More Effectively.</h1><br></br>
            <p>If you have a dishwasher and a garbage disposal, the water from the dishwasher cycle will drain through the disposal so that any food debris can be ground up by the disposal to prevent clogs in your drain pipes. When the disposal is broken or clogged, the dishwasher could back up and fail to drain properly, meaning your dishes won’t get clean and the water could leak out onto the floor. </p><br></br>
        
            <h1>3. Fix or Prevent a Leaky Disposal. </h1><br></br>
          
            <p> Garbage disposals can develop leaks, either in the disposal itself or the pipes connected to it. A leaky garbage disposal can cause serious water flooding in your kitchen, and water damage is costly to repair. Fixing leaks in your garbage disposal can prevent water damage to your cabinets and kitchen floor. </p>
            <h1>4. Your Disposal Will Smell Fresher. </h1><br></br>
            
            <p> A garbage disposal that is not working properly can develop an unpleasant odor from food debris and mildew that is trapped in the drain or disposal. By repairing your garbage disposal you can freshen up your sink and the overall smell of your kitchen and home. </p>
            <h1>5. Your Disposal Will Function Properly. </h1><br></br>
          
            <p> The ultimate benefit of garbage disposal repair is that your garbage disposal will function properly both now and in the future, preventing water damage, bad smells and dishwasher malfunction. </p>
            <h1>Can I Repair My Own Garbage Disposal?</h1><br></br>
