           Washing machines have various cycles, all of which are controlled by a timer. The timer’s job is to tell the washing machine how long to stay on each part of the wash cycle and when to advance to the next step in the cycle.

            <h1>Safety Precautions Before Installation</h1><br></br>
            <p>Before you begin installing your OTR microwave, it’s important to take the necessary safety precautions. Make sure to turn off the circuit breaker that powers the area where you will be

working. If you’re not sure which circuit breaker to turn off, turn off the main breaker to be safe. You should also wear safety gloves and goggles to protect yourself from any debris or dust that may be generated during the installation process.

You also want to ensure you have all the necessary tools. You’ll need a drill, a stud finder, a level, measuring tape, a screwdriver, and a pencil. It’s also a good idea to have someone to help you hold the microwave while you install it.</p>
            <h1>Measuring and Preparing the Installation Area</h1><br></br>
            <p>The first step in installing your OTR microwave is to measure and prepare the installation area. Measure the width of the space above your stove to ensure that the microwave will fit. You should also measure the distance between the bottom of the cabinet and the stove to determine the height at which the microwave should be installed.

Once you’ve measured the space, you’ll need to prepare the area for installation. Use the stud finder to locate the studs in the wall behind the installation area. Mark the location of the studs with a pencil. This will help you mount the microwave bracket securely to the wall.</p>
           <h1>Mounting the Microwave Bracket on the Wall</h1><br></br>
           <p>Once you’ve located the studs and marked their location, it’s time to mount the microwave bracket on the wall. Use the level to ensure that the bracket is straight.

Mark the location of the screw holes with a pencil. 
Use the drill to make pilot holes for the screws. 
Then, use the screwdriver to secure the bracket to the wall. Make sure the bracket is securely mounted to the wall before proceeding. </p>
