           <p> Refrigerators come in a variety of sizes and configurations. If you’re in the market for a new fridge, you may be wondering what size is right for your kitchen. There are a few different things to consider when it comes to choosing a refrigerator that is the appropriate size for your space. When the refrigerator fits the space that was designed for it, it operates more efficiently and will need fewer <span className="color">repairs. </span>
           <br></br>
           <br></br>

How do you choose the correct size refrigerator? Here’s how to properly measure for optimal success.

            <h1>Standard Refrigerator Heights</h1><br></br>
            <p>Full size kitchen refrigerators can range anywhere from 60 and 75 inches in height. Average standard refrigerators typically fall between 62 and 72 inches tall. These days, depending on how tall you are, your fridge will likely reach over your head. This is to prevent people from having to bend down to look into the refrigerator and find things. </p>
            <h1>Refrigerator Widths</h1><br></br>
            <p>The width of a standard refrigerator may range anywhere from 23 to 36 inches. On average a medium sized refrigerator would fall somewhere between 30 and 33 inches wide. This is the dimension with the door closed. When the door of the fridge is open it will be a few inches wider. </p>
           <h1>Refrigerator Depths</h1><br></br>
           <p>The depth of a refrigerator is the measurement from back to front, or from the wall behind it to the front of the door. This is referring to the outside measurements, not the inside square footage for food storage. Refrigerator depths range from 29 to 36 inches. </p>
           <h1>Refrigerator Configurations</h1><br></br>
           <p>Refrigerator models vary in terms of configuration, meaning the way the parts of the refrigerator are arranged. For example: 

Top freezer. The standard refrigerator configuration has the freezer on top and the refrigerator on the bottom with a single door for each that opens on the same side. 
Bottom freezer. The freezer on the bottom slides open like a drawer with the refrigerator on top. The upper refrigerator may have one door that opens from the side, or two french doors on top that open in the middle. 
Side by side. A side by side freezer and refrigerator has french doors that open from the middle. The freezer is typically on the left side with the refrigerator on the right. </p>
           <h1>How to Measure Your Refrigerator Space</h1><br></br>
           <p>The key to getting the right size refrigerator for your kitchen is to accurately measure the space, taking into account the cabinet height, counters, and baseboards. Here’s how to take each measurement: 

Height. Measure the height of the space where your refrigerator will be placed starting with the floor and going up to the cabinets, molding, or ceiling, whatever is there. 
Width. When measuring the width of the space start at the wall and measure to the other side, whether it is a wall or cabinets or counter. If there are baseboards, measure from the furthest point the baseboard protrudes from the wall on both sides. There also needs to be enough room on the sides for the doors to open and close properly without hitting the wall. 
Depth. Measure from the back wall to the front edge of the counters or side wall. If there is a baseboard in the back, measure from the furthest edge that protrudes from the wall.
 </p>
 <h1>The Importance of Ventilation Space</h1><br></br>
 <p>When it comes to choosing your refrigerator size, be sure to leave at last one inch of space between the back wall and the refrigerator and ½ inch on each side of the fridge and on top. The refrigerator needs to have room to properly ventilate the heat that is generated and draw air in for the cooling process. 

Without ventilation space your refrigerator could be overworked and become overheated, meaning it will work less efficiently and may wear out more quickly. If your refrigerator is pushed too tightly against the wall in the back or if the overhang and side walls are too close, you could find yourself in need of refrigerator repair sooner than expected. </p>
